    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA is a high-tension business, where is each team is constantly fighting to maintain only the highest skilled players.  While the top 25 big hitters tend to remain relatively static, the rest of the 450+ players in the league can come and go at any moment.  This can have a great impact on the team and the players.  Trades in the NBA are quite complex, dealing with variables such as salary cap, the NBA collective bargaining agreement(CBA), as well as the team's personal needs.  Some research has already been done on the effects of trades on NBA teams as well as work on predicting factors in NBA player and team success.   \n",
    "\n",
    "The NBA is also a very stat-heavy sport. NBA games are decided by whichever team has the most points. However, that doesn’t mean Basketball is just about outsourcing your opponent. There are many other factors that are looked upon. Mainly: assists, rebounds, blocks, steals, and turnovers. Each of these variables could be a factor in increasing the points of a team. Assists count when an NBA player passes the ball to another player and that player manages to score some points. A rebound is when another player attempts a shot, and the player catches the ball as it's falling down. A block is when a player manages to deflect a player's shot from his goal. A steal is when a player manages to gain possession from the other team. Finally, a turnover is when a player loses control of the ball, and the opposing team gains possession. Obviously, it is better to have higher stats in all of the mentioned above except turnovers. In this study, we will be looking at these stats and many others to determine how a player is performing in a season. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prior Work\n",
    "\n",
    "In a 2020 article by Michael C. Wright (Reference 1), Wright talks to players about the effect that trades can have on the team's morale.  Players mentioned how close wins and tough losses throughout a season can create strong bonds and chemistry between players.  Teams with good chemistry are generally more successful and thus make it closer to the Finals.  The NBA veterans note that it is something they can get used to.  For instance, early in their career, it can have a big impact on how they play, but as they get older they realize it is just a part of the business and it does not affect them as much.  Even still, players that might play together for 5 or more years can easily be separated at any time.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Work on predicting NBA results has been done before.  The website fivethirtyeight.com (Reference 2) uses player projections that take into account factors, such as physiological, scoring, tendencies, passing, and defense, among other variables.  This data is compared to past NBA players to predict that player's season.  The site then runs simulations on this data to form predicted season statistics for each team.  While this is a reasonable predictor, it fails to take into consideration any phycological factors that can arise from trading, as mentioned previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another source we looked at (Reference 3) found the most important stats when looking at team performances. Generally, a lot of team performance can’t be calculated into a number, however, this website managed to find a correlation between some stats and the likelihood of winning. They specifically looked at Rebounds, Turnovers, Field goal %, Free throw %, and Fouls. They found that the team with the higher Field goal % is 75% more likely to win the game and that the team with the highest Free throw % is 70% more likely to win. However, just because these stats may be higher for some teams, it doesn't always mean they will win the game.\n",
